# Knowledge base for the agent

Drop here **.txt**, **.md**, or **.pdf** files about you (resume, bio, FAQs, projects).

Their contents are loaded into the agent's context at startup. The agent will use this information to answer questions and will not invent details that aren't here.

Examples:
- `bio.txt` – short professional bio
- `resume.pdf` – resume or CV (PDF)
- `resume.md` – resume in markdown
- `faq.md` – frequently asked questions and answers
